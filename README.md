1. Make sure you are running Python 3.6 or newer.

`sudo apt-get install python3-pip python-dev`

2. Install ursina

`pip3 install ursina`


### Potential Errors/Issues You Run Into

If you are getting this error when trying to install ursina:

***`The headers or library files could not be found for zlib,
    a required dependency when compiling Pillow from source.`***
    
Try running the following line:

`sudo apt install libjpeg-dev zlib1g zlib1g-dev`
